>2.1) Definition^[Post Lecture 1, 01-10-24, [[Introduction to Analysis by Gaughan]]]: Let $S$ be a set of real numbers. A real number $A$ is an **accumulation point** of $S$ if and only if every neighborhood of $A$ contains infinitely many points of $S$.  

>2.2) Definition^[Post Lecture 1, 01-10-24, [[Introduction to Analysis by Gaughan]]]: A function $f: D \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ is **uniformly continuous** on $E \subset D$ if and only if for every $\mathcal{E} > 0$, there is $\delta > 0$ such that if $x, y \in E$ with $|x - y| < \delta$, then $|f(x) - f(y)| < \mathcal{E}$.
>>Related definition: If $f$ is uniformly continuous on $D$, we say $f$ is uniformly continuous.

>2.3) Remarks concerning Continuity and Differentiability^[Lecture 1, 01-09-2024, [[Introduction to Analysis by Gaughan]]]: ([[1 - Differentiation of Functions]])
>>$f$ is not continuous at $x_{0}$ $\implies$ $f$ is not differentiable at $x_0$
>
>>$f$ is continuous at $x_0$ $\centernot \implies$ $f$ is differentiable at $x_0$
>
>>$f$ is differentiable at $\forall x \in D$ $\centernot \implies$ $f$ is uniformly continuous on $D$
