>5.1) Definition^[Lecture 2, 01-11-2024, [[A Course in Group Theory by Humphreys]]]: A bijection $\pi$ from a set $X$ to itself is a **permutation** on $X$ ([[9 - Injective and Surjective Functions]]).
>>Note: It must be a bijection, otherwise not every element would be mapped to exactly one element.

>5.2) Fact^[Lecture 2, 01-11-2024, [[A Course in Group Theory by Humphreys]]]: The set of all permutations on $X$ is denoted by $S(X)$ ([[6 - Notation]]).

>5.3) Corollary^[Lecture 2, 01-11-2024, [[A Course in Group Theory by Humphreys]]]: Let $X$ be any set. Then the set $S(X)$ of permutations $f:X \mapsto X$ is a group under composition of functions ([[10 - Groups]]).
