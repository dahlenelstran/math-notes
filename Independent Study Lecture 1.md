## History of Classical Mechanics
- Isaac Newton created Calculus and Classic Mechanics
- Classical Mechanics: Newton's Second Law - $m \times x''(t) = f(x,t)$
	- This is a system of differential equations
	- With initial conditions, $\exists! x$ 
- Initial conditions: $x(0)=x_0, x'(0)=x_1$
	- This is initial condition and initial velocity
- Given this, we can find trajectory $x(t) \forall t \geq 0$
- In reality, "thick" trajectories can better describe

## Classical Mechanics
- in $\mathbb{R}^1$, if we have a spring with $k$ rigidity and $x$ displacement, then $f=-kx$ so we have $mx''=-kx$
- This is a homogeneous ordinary differential equation
- Given $x''+\frac{k}{m}x=0$ with initial conditions, we can solve as a differential equation

## Energy of a system
- $mx'' + kx = 0$ becomes $\frac{1}{2}mx''x'+\frac{k}{2}xx'=0$, so that we can move forward
- Energy of a system is defined to be $E(t):= \frac{1}{2}mx'^{2}+\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, but we also have $E(t):=\mathbb{K} + \mathbb{P}$ where $\mathbb{K}$ is kinetic and $\mathbb{P}$ is potential energy. So $\frac{1}{2}mx'^{2}=\mathbb{K}$ and $\frac{1}{2}kx^2=\mathbb{P}$. 

## Phase Picture
- A Phase Plane is a graph with a dependent variable of $x'$ and an independent variable of $x$. 
- To make the Phase Picture, let $\frac{m}{2}=\frac{k}{2}=1$ so that we have an ellipse.

## Homework:
Which way does the trajectory go along the ellipse? Positive or negative direction?
