## Recap
- Energy: $mx' + kx =0$
	- Let $T = \frac{1}{2}mx'^2$ and $\Pi=\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ 
	- Because conservation of energy, $(T+\Pi)(t)=(T+\Pi)(0)$, meaning that the energy at any given point must equal the original energy.
## Lagrange Principle
- $L = \Pi - K$

## Green's Function
$$G(x,s)=\left\{s(x-1), s \leq x; x(s-1), s >x\right\}$$
