## History of Classical Mechanics
- Isaac Newton created Calculus and Classic Mechanics
- Classical Mechanics: Newton's Second Law - $m \times x''(t) = f(x,t)$
	- This is a system of differential equations
	- With initial conditions, $\exists! x$ 
- Initial conditions: $x(0)=x_0, x'(0)=x_1$
	- This is initial condition and initial velocity
- Given this, we can find trajectory $x(t) \forall t \geq 0$
- In reality, "thick" trajectories can better describe

## Classical Mechanics
- in $\mathbb{R}^1$, if we have a spring with $k$ rigidity and $x$ displacement, then $f=-kx$ so we have $mx''=-kx$
- This is a homogeneous ordinary differential equation
- Given $x''+\frac{k}{m}x=0$ with initial conditions, we can solve as a differential equation

## Energy of a system
- $mx'' + kx = 0$ becomes $\frac{1}{2}mx''x'+\frac{k}{2}xx'=0$, so that we can move forward
- Energy of a system is defined to be $E(t):= \frac{1}{2}mx'^{2}+\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, but we also have $E(t):=\mathbb{K} + \mathbb{P}$ where $\mathbb{K}$ is kinetic and $\mathbb{P}$ is potential energy. So $\frac{1}{2}mx'^{2}=\mathbb{K}$ and $\frac{1}{2}kx^2=\mathbb{P}$. 

## Phase Picture
- A Phase Plane is a graph with a dependent variable of $x'$ and an independent variable of $x$.

- To make the Phase Picture, let $\frac{m}{2}=\frac{k}{2}=1$ so that we have an ellipse.

## Homework:
Which way does the trajectory go along the ellipse? Positive or negative direction?

## Post Lecture Studies
- I think the trajectory is going in the clockwise, or positive, direction. This is because the spring, when let go from the maximum $x$ position, will go backwards resulting in a negative velocity, until it reaches it's natural state $x=0$, in which it will still go back, but slower as the spring builds up tension, until it is at the minimum position. Then, it will spring forward quickly until the natural state $x=0$, and then go forward slowly until the maximum. A similar event occurs when it is let go from the minimum $x=0$ position.
