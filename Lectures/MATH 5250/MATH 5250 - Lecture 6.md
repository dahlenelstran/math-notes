>Proposition: Let $G$ be a finite cyclic group of order $n$. For any divisor $d$ of $n$, the group $G$ has precisely one subgroup $G_d$ with $d$ elements. The number of group elements $x$ satisfying the equation $x^d=1$ is $d$ and these are precisely the elements of the subgroup $G_d$.
>>Proof: Was told not to worry about this one. 

>Let $G$ be a cyclic group with $n$ elements, generated by an element $g$. Let $a=g^i$. Then $a$ generates a cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$ of order $n/d$, where $d$ is the greatest common divisor of $n$ and $i$.
