>Remark: The order relation^[[[13 - Relations]]] $<$ has the least upper bound property.

>Definition: Let $A$ be a nonempty collection of sets. An **indexing function** for $A$ is a surjective^[[[9 - Injective and Surjective Functions]]] function^[[[11 - Functions (or Maps)]]] $f$ from some set $J$, called the **index set**, to $A$. The collection $A$, together with the indexing function $f$, is called an **indexed family of sets**. Given $\alpha \in J$, we shall denote the set $f(\alpha)$ by the symbol $A_\alpha$. And we shall denote the indexed family itself by the symbol $\{A_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in J}$, which is read "the family of all $A_\alpha$, as $\alpha$ ranges over $J$.
>>Note that the indexing function is required to be surjective, but not injective. It is possible for $A_a = A_b$, but $a \neq b$. 

>Definition: An **arbitrary union of sets** is defined as $$\bigcup_{{\alpha \in J}} A_{\alpha}=\{x | \text{ for at least one } \alpha \in J, x \in A_{\alpha}\}$$ while an **arbitrary intersection of sets** is defined as $$\bigcap_{{\alpha \in J}} A_{\alpha}=\{x | \text{ for every } \alpha \in J, x \in A_{\alpha}\}$$>Note that the arbitrary union equals the union of all the elements of $A$, and the arbitrary intersection the intersection of all the elements in $A$. 
 
>Definition: Let $m$ be a positive integer. Given a set $X$, we define an **$m$-tuple** of elements of $X$ to be a function $x: \{1, \dots, m\} \mapsto X$. If $x$ is an $m$-tuple, we often denote the value of $x$ at $i$ by the symbol $x_i$ rather than $x(i)$ and call it the **$i$th coordinate of $x$**. And we often denote the function $x$ itself by the symbol $(x_1, \dots,  x_m)$.
