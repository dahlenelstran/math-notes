**Assignment: Read Theorem 6.2 + Corollaries, Section 7. Do problem 5.4 d and e**

>Theorem: Let $A$ be a set; suppose that there exists a bijection^[[[9 - Injective and Surjective Functions]]] $f: A \mapsto \{1, \dots, n\}$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Z_+}$. Let $B$ be a proper subset^[[[3 - Set Theory]]] of $A$. Then there exists no bijection $g: B \mapsto \{1, \dots, n\}$; but (provided $B \neq \emptyset$) there does exist a bijection $h: B \mapsto \{1, \dots, m\}$ for some $m < n$. 
>>Proof was not necessary for study

>>Corollary: If $A$ is infinite, there is no bijection of $A$ with a proper subset of itself.
>>Corollary: $\mathbb{Z_+}$ is not finite.
>>Corollary: The cardinality^[[[21 - Cardinality]]] of a finite set $A$ is uniquely determined by $A$. 
>>Corollary: If  $B$ is a subset of the finite set $A$, then $B$ is finite. If $B$ is a proper subset of $A$, then the cardinality of $B$ is less than the cardinality of $A$. 
>>Corollary: Let $B$ be a nonempty set. Then the following are equivalent :
>>	1. $B$ is finite.
>>	2. There is a surjective function from a section of the positive integers onto $B$.
>>	3. There is an injective function from $B$ into a section of the positive integers.
>>Corollary: Finite unions and finite cartesian products of finite sets are finite.
