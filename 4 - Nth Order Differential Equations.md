>4.1) Definition^[Week 1, Spring 2024, [[Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems by Boyce and DiPrima]]]: An $n$th order differential equation is an equation of the form $$P_{0}(t) \frac{d^ny}{dt^n}+P_{1}(t) \frac{d^{n-1}y}{dt^{n-1}} + \dots + P_{n-1}(t)\frac{dy}{dt}+P_{n}(t)y = G(t)$$We assume that the functions $P_0, \dots, P_n,$ and $G$ are continuous, real-valued functions on some interval $I: \alpha < t < \beta$, and that $P_0$ is nowhere zero in this interval. We can then divide that equation by
