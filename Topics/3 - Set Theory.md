>3.1) Definition^[[[Topology - Assignment 1]]]: If both *A* and *B* are sets, *A* is a **proper subset** of *B* if *A* is within *B*, but not equal to it. This is denoted by the subset notation without the line below it: $A \subset B$. If $A$ is in $B$, but not necessarily not equal to it, then we say it is a **subset** of $B$, denoted by: $A \subseteq B$.  

>3.2) Fact^[[[Topology - Assignment 1]]]: Any set intersected with the empty set is the empty set, and any set unioned with the empty set is itself.

>3.3) Definition^[[[Topology - Assignment 1]]]: The **difference** of two sets, denoted $A - B$ is defined as the set consisting of those elements of A that are not in B, which can be formally represented as $\{A - B = x | x \in A \text{ and } x \not \in B\}$.
>>It can also be referred to as the **complement** of B relative to A

>3.4) **Distributive Law**^[[[Topology - Assignment 1]]]: $A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap ( A \cup C)$.

>3.5) **DeMorgan's Law**^[[[Topology - Assignment 1]]]: $A - (B \cup C) = (A-B) \cap (A-C)$.

>3.6) Definition^[[[Topology - Assignment 1]]]: A **Powerset** of a set A is the set of A and all subsets of A.
