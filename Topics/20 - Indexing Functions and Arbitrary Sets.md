>20.1) Definition^[[[Topology - Assignment 3]]]: Let $A$ be a nonempty collection of sets. An **indexing function** for $A$ is a surjective^[[[9 - Injective and Surjective Functions]]] function^[[[11 - Functions (or Maps)]]] $f$ from some set $J$, called the **index set**, to $A$. The collection $A$, together with the indexing function $f$, is called an **indexed family of sets**. Given $\alpha \in J$, we shall denote the set $f(\alpha)$ by the symbol $A_\alpha$. And we shall denote the indexed family itself by the symbol $\{A_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in J}$, which is read "the family of all $A_\alpha$, as $\alpha$ ranges over $J$.
>>Note that the indexing function is required to be surjective, but not injective. It is possible for $A_a = A_b$, but $a \neq b$. 

>20.2) Definition^[[[Topology - Assignment 3]]]: An **arbitrary union of sets^[[[3 - Set Theory]]]** is defined as $$\bigcup_{{\alpha \in J}} A_{\alpha}=\{x | \text{ for at least one } \alpha \in J, x \in A_{\alpha}\}$$ while an **arbitrary intersection of sets** is defined as $$\bigcap_{{\alpha \in J}} A_{\alpha}=\{x | \text{ for every } \alpha \in J, x \in A_{\alpha}\}$$>Note that the arbitrary union equals the union of all the elements of $A$, and the arbitrary intersection the intersection of all the elements in $A$. 
 
>20.3) Definition^[[[Topology - Assignment 3]]]: Let $m$ be a positive integer. Given a set $X$, we define an **$m$-tuple** of elements of $X$ to be a function $x: \{1, \dots, m\} \mapsto X$. If $x$ is an $m$-tuple, we often denote the value of $x$ at $i$ by the symbol $x_i$ rather than $x(i)$ and call it the **$i$th coordinate of $x$**. And we often denote the function $x$ itself by the symbol $(x_1, \dots,  x_m)$.

>20.4) Definition^[[[Topology - Assignment 3]]]: Let $\{A_1, \dots, A_m\}$ be a family of sets indexed with the set $\{1, \dots, m\}$. Let $X= A_1 \cup \dots \cup A_m$. We define the **cartesian product** of this indexed family, denoted by $\prod_{i=1}^m A_i$ or $A_1 \times \dots \times A_m$, to be the set of all $m$-tuples $(x_1, \dots, x_m)$ of elements of $X$ such that $x_i \in A_i$ for each $i$. 

>20.5) Definition^[[[Topology - Assignment 3]]]: Given a set $X$, we define an $\omega$-tuple of elements of $X$ to be a function $x: \mathbb{Z}_+ \mapsto X$. We also call such a function a **sequence**, or an **infinite sequence**, of elements of $X$. If $x$ is an $\omega$-tuple, we often denote the value of $x$ at $i$ by $x_i$ rather than $x(i)$, and call it the $i$th coordinate of $x$. We denote $x$ itself by the symbol $(x_1, x_2, \dots)$ or $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_+}$. 

>20.6) Definition^[[[Topology - Assignment 3]]]: Let $\{A_1, \dots, A_m\}$ be a family of sets indexed with the positive integers. Let $X$ be the union of the sets in this family. The **cartesian product** of this indexed family of sets, denoted by $\prod_{i \in \mathbb{Z}_+} A_i$ or $A_i \times A_2 \times \dots$, is defined to be the set of all $\omega$-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots)$ of elements of $X$ such that $x_i \in A_i$ for each $i$.
