>5.1) Definition^[[[MATH 5250 - Lecture 2]]]: A bijection^[[[9 - Injective and Surjective Functions]]] $\pi$ from a set $X$ to itself is a **permutation** on $X$.
>>Note: It must be a bijection, otherwise not every element would be mapped to exactly one element.

>5.2) Fact^[[[MATH 5250 - Lecture 2]]]: The set of all permutations on $X$ is denoted by $S(X)$.

>5.3) Corollary^[[[MATH 5250 - Lecture 2]]]: Let $X$ be any set. Then the set $S(X)$ of permutations $f:X \mapsto X$ is a group^[[[10 - Groups]]] under composition of functions.
