>6.1) Definition^[[[Topology - Assignment 2]]]: We say that a subset $A_0$ of $A$ is **bounded above** if there is an element $b$ of $A$ such that $x \leq b$ for every $x \in A_0$; the element $b$ is called an **upper bound** for $A_0$. If the set of all upper bounds for $A_0$ has a smallest element, that element is called the **least upper bound**, or the **supremum**, of $A_0$.
>>This is written as $sup_{A_0}$ 
>>The same thing can be said for subsets **bounded below**, and the element is referred to as the **infimum**.

>6.2) Definition^[[[Topology - Assignment 2]]]: An ordered set $A$ is said to have the **least upper bound property** if every nonempty subset $A_0$ of $A$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound.
>>The same thing can be said for the **greatest lower bound property**.

>>Remark^[[[Topology - Assignment 3]]]: The order relation^[[[13 - Relations]]] $<$ has the least upper bound property.
