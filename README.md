# math-notes

## This is really just for my own use! 
I use [ObsidianMD](https://obsidian.md/) to keep track of my notes, at least for the Spring 2024 semester, and need a way to keep them locally on my devices for quick access, as well as in the cloud so I can change them on my macbook and my desktop. So of course I set up a GitHub repo! Feel free to browse my notes if you'd like to learn something. Currently, it contains notes on the following classes: 
- MATH 5500: Introduction to Analysis II
- MATH 5450: Ordinary Differential Equations
- MATH 5250: Modern Algebra I

Essentially how I organize it, is for each class I create a file for the textbook. Then, as we follow the textbook, I create pages for each topic and record the theorems and definitions we learn, creating connections between topics where necessary.

The goal for this note-taking strategy is simple: I want to be able to recognize the overlap and bid ideas of my classes together more easily. I'm hoping this will achieve that!
