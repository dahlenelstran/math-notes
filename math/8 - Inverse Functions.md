>8.1) Fact^[Lecture 1, 01-14-2024, [[Topology by Munkres]]]: If a given function *f* is bijective, then *f* has a unique inverse, denoted by $f^{-1}$ and it is also bijective ([[11 - Functions (or Maps)]]).

>8.2) Fact^[Lecture 2, 01-11-2024, [[A Course in Group Theory by Humphreys]]]: Given a function $f: X \mapsto Y$, we say that $f$ has an inverse map, $f^{-1}$, if there is a map $g: Y \mapsto X$ such that $g \circ f= {id}_x$ and $f \circ g= {id}_x$.

>8.3) Theorem^[Lecture 2, 01-11-2024, [[A Course in Group Theory by Humphreys]]]: If a given map has an inverse, it will be unique. 
>>Proof: Suppose that $g$ and $h$ are both inverses for $f$. This implies $g \circ f = h \circ f = id_x$  and $f \circ g = f \circ h = id_y$. Then $$h = h \circ id_y = h \circ ( f \circ g)
 = (h \circ f) \circ g =id_x \circ g = g$$
